# Complete nalysis of online Shopping behavior
The goal is to develop Machine Learning Models to present a complete analysis for online shopping behavior data set.

Built a predictive classification model with ensuring optimal features and classifier.
Showing and explaining the hyper-parameter fitting process and verifying work with AutoML.
Generating user-behavior clusters based on the purchasing behavior data for the complete dataset.
Built a Semi-Supervised self labelling model to estimate 'Revenue' for the missing records and then fit the classifier.
Reporting classification performance on data set with and without the self-labelled data.


* Fit a best Linear and non-linear classifier and explaining the optimal features set and dimensions. Linear classifier aids explainability while non-linear classifier enhance classification performance.

* Showing and explaining the hyper-parameter fitting process.

* Verifying the work with AutoML to baseline and explaining the rationale behind choices of classifier, parameters and features.

* Built a predictive classification model. Trained the model on data entries corresponding to the months of June-Dec, and tested the model on data entries corresponding to Feb-March.

* Generating user-behavior clusters based on the purchasing behavior data for the complete dataset.

* Identifying the significant differences between the various clusters in terms of the size of the clusters and purchase ratio.

* Returning plots and cluster images generated for the data.

* Performed a detailed analysis for each cluster corresponding to the variations in features and identifying some behaviors corresponding to each particular cluster.

* Built a Semi-Supervised self labelling model to estimate 'Revenue' for the missing records in Oct-Dec and then fit the classifier. Report classification performance on Feb-March data set with and without the self-labelled data.

* Using the self labelled data and training data together compared the classification performance on Test data.
