# complete-analysis-of-online-Shopping-behavior
The goal is to develop Machine Learning Models to present a complete analysis for online shopping behavior data set.

Built a predictive classification model with ensuring optimal features and classifier.
Showing and explaining the hyper-parameter fitting process and verifying work with AutoML.
Generating user-behavior clusters based on the purchasing behavior data for the complete dataset.
Built a Semi-Supervised self labelling model to estimate 'Revenue' for the missing records and then fit the classifier.
Reporting classification performance on data set with and without the self-labelled data.
